# Observer

Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism with a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object (subject/observable) changes state, all of its dependents (observers) are notified and updated automatically.

[Conceptual Example](examples/conceptual.ts)
