# Design Patterns

Design Patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are blueprints that can be taken and customized to solve a particular design problem in your code.

The best way to use patterns is to load your brain with them and
then recognize places in your designs and existing applications where you can
apply them.

Instead of code reuse, with patterns you get experience reuse.
